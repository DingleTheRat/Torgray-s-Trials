## Changes in latest update
**IMPORTANT: If you played earlier versions, delete the `torgrays-trials-config` in your user home directory to not cause issues**
### Shop System
A cute lil guy by the name of Coiner arrived to the world! Find a hut somewhere and go in it to find Coiner! Coiner sells a bunch of new stuff like Maps, Keys, Sticks and Torgray's Soup. In order to buy them, you need coins that are obtained by killing Dracores who drop 1-3 of them or by selling some of your goodies to Coiner. You can also now see how many you have in your inventory!

### Darkness Cycles
There are now Darkness Cycles! Darkness cycles are like day and night cycles, but instead, depending on the state it can be dark or darker. It Cycles through:
- Night
- New Dusk
- Gloom
- Dusk

It takes more time to cycles depending on the state. Night is the brightest one and Gloom is the darkest. During Gloom, enemies are more aggressive and get more health and do more damage. There are also two variants of Gloom:
- Light Gloom
- Dark Gloom

Sadly, only Torgray's Soup knows what they do. But I heard the chances change depending on the mode.

### Other Stuff

- Removed the key behind the pond
